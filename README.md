# filewatch
filewatch monitors for any changes in a directory and recompiles code automatically.
It is a tool for helping developers with compilation of small projects.

## Example
`filewatch <dirname>`
### Entering files to watch
![Alt text](examples/demo.png?raw=true "file watch")

### Error in the source code being watched
![Alt text](examples/4.png?raw=true "file watch")

### Issue fixed, make is called by filewatch automatically
![Alt text](examples/5.png?raw=true "file watch")
